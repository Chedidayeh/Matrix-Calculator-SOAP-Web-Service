The **Matrix Calculator SOAP Web Service** is a Java-based project that implements a SOAP web service for performing matrix operations, such as addition and multiplication. Built using JAX-WS, it exposes operations through a WSDL interface, allowing clients to send matrix data via SOAP requests. The service handles 2D matrices (represented as `double[][]`) and includes error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., null or empty matrices). Managed with Maven, it relies on dependencies like JAX-WS and JAXB. The project is designed to run locally, published via `Endpoint`, and can be tested using SoapUI. Itâ€™s a practical example of SOAP-based web services for mathematical computations.
